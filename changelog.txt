Flowframes 1.36.0 Changelog:
- Added RIFE 4.0 model which is both faster and higher quality than 3.9
- Fixed issue with GIF exporting where auto-encode would try to mux a h264 stream into GIF
- Fixed custom output folder not working for batch processing
- Fixed issues where the batch queue could get stuck waiting for ffmpeg to finish
- Minor improvements by backporting Nmkoder code


Flowframes 1.35.0 Changelog:
- Updated RIFE - It now supports any interpolation factor (like 3x, 5x, 10x, ...)
- Added RIFE 3.9 model, big speed improvements (54% faster than 3.1, 100% faster than 2.3)
- WEBM/VP9 encoding is now signficantly more efficient by using 2-pass (but also a bit slower)
- Updated ffmpeg to 4.4.1 (possible encoding/decoding speed improvements)
- Fixed some specific encoding parameters being set incorrectly (auto-tiling)


Flowframes 1.34.1 Changelog:
- Audio will now be slowed down accordingly when using slowmo
- Optimized encoding: VP9 and AV1 dynamic tiling, h264/h265/VP9/AV1 dynamic keyframe interval
- Fixed unreliable audio channel count detection for audio fallback
- Fixed temp folder deletion dialog interrupting batch processing


Flowframes 1.34.0 Changelog:
- Added resuming functionality (with auto-encode) - Drop a temp folder to resume it
- Resuming an already fully interpolated folder will instead just merge all chunks and mux audio
- Audio: MP3 tracks will no longer get re-encoded to AAC when using MP4 output
- Audio: Opus in MP4 (without re-encoding) can now be enabled with config option "allowOpusInMp4"
- Audio Fallback: Improved AAC fallback quality
- Audio Fallback: Use same channel count as input file, no longer force Stereo
- Fixed problems with weird frame rates where Flowframes would claim it's invalid


Flowframes 1.33.0 Changelog:
- Added option to set quality when using image sequence output (fixes bad WEBP quality)
- Added server selection option (Automatic/EU/US) to allow manual selection of server
- The last selected output mode is now remembered after closing Flowframes
- Fixed issues with GPU list
- Minor UI improvements (uniform/updated PayPal, Discord icons)
- Minor UX improvements (clarify that image sequences require manual FPS input)


Flowframes 1.32.0 Changelog:
- Added slow-motion option to easily create slow-mo interpolations
- Auto-Encode now works with Image Sequence exports
- Option to create both limited and unlimited FPS outputs now works with image sequences
- Added automatic ping-based server picker to download models from US or EU server
- Added config option to enable custom interpolation factor (if compatible)
- ProRes now supports Alpha output when used with profile 4444 or 4444xq
- Fixed ProRes being locked to YUV420 colors on all presets
- Fixed WEBP image sequence export not working correctly


Flowframes 1.31.1 Changelog:
- Fixed problems that broke XVFI when using embedded python runtime
- Fixed model downloader not offering the option to download XVFI models


Flowframes 1.31.0 Changelog:
- Added XVFI interpolation AI, allows all interpolation factors from 2-10
- Unlocked 16x interpolation for RIFE-CUDA (quality will be worse than lower factors!)
- Unlocked 3x, 5x, 6x, 7x factors for DAIN-NCNN
- GPUs are now listed in the application's window title
- Batch: Notifications now only show on queue completion, not after each interpolation
- If interpolation fails, the last 10 lines of the corresponding log are shown
- Minor UI improvements
- Fixed custom output directory not being applied when using the batch queue
- Some internal refactoring and code cleanup


Flowframes 1.30.0 Changelog:
- Added the option to Close/Sleep/Hibernate/Shutdown after interpolation
- Added notifications that will show if an interpolation finished in the background
- Added option to change default output directory (same as input or custom)
- Added basic command line arguments to automate Flowframes interpolation
- Added move up/down buttons to batch processing queue
- Fixed a bug that would set incorrect default values for certain settings
