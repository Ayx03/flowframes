- Added a button in the settings to reset the config to default
- Added a shortcut button to the Encoding Settings on the main tab
- Added option to disable Preview tab
- Fixed problem where videos with BT470M color format would fail to encode

Flowframes 1.28.1 Changelog:
- Added option to auto-pause interpolation if auto-encode can't keep up
- Auto-Encode: Old frames now get deleted instead of being replaced by dummy files
- Fixed speed regression on RIFE 3.x (up to ~1.5x as fast as in 1.28.0)


Flowframes 1.28.0 Changelog:
- Updated RIFE CUDA to 3.8 (Skipped previous models)
- Added native transparency support with RIFE CUDA 3.8
- Added model downloader to pre-download all models at once
- Added support for loading custom AI models
- Improved model loading (faster file validation and lots of internal changes)
- Step-by-step mode: Previous steps now run automatically if needed


Flowframes 1.27.2 Changelog:
- Added Backup option - Will save an incomplete video after every chunk encode
- Custom FFmpeg args now also get applied for GIF encoding, not just videos
- Fixed low disk space warning popping up even if interpolation is already paused
- Fixed certain temp files not being deleted correctly


Flowframes 1.27.1 Changelog:
- Image sequence inputs can now be used without any importing/copying (if compatible)
- Added the FPS limit ("Maximum Output Framerate") to Quick Settings tab
- Batch Processing: AI Model name is now shown in queue
- Batch Processing: Fixed problems where GIFs/videos would play too slow
- Fixed problem where GIF/APNG interpolations would have unnecessary dupe frames
